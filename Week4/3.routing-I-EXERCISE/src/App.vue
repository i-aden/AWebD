  Implementing and Adding a Message Feed Page Using Vue Router
  ============================================================
  We are going to create a new page that displays a list of messages to the user. 
  Users will be able to visit this page whenever they enter the "localhost:5173/messages" path in the browser.

  1. We create a new view component called MessageFeed by adding a MessageFeed.vue file to the ./src/views/ folder.
  2. In MessageFeed.vue:
      a. The component will render a list of messages. 
      Our message list is defined as an array of strings called messages.
  3. There should be an index.js router file located at src/router/index.js. 
  4. In index.js:
      a. There should be a router instance with a routes array.
      b. Declare a route designated for MessageFeed, named messageFeed and with its path set to /messages. 
          We do this by appending an object with the required information to the routes array.
  5. In your browser, visit localhost:5173/messages.
      The page should appear with the correct content â€“ the Message Feed page.
  6. 'router-view' is in charge of rendering the correct active view content relative to the URL path while 
      'router-link' is a Vue component that helps users to navigate within an app that has routing enabled. 
      By default, it renders an anchor tag <a> with a correct href link generated by its to prop.

      In App.vue:
      Add a navigation link to the message feed route. (Follow the Home and About examples).
  7. Save and in your browser, you should see a Messages link. Use it to visit the Message Feed.
  8. We can also specify a router link by bind a location descriptor object to the its "to" prop, e.g., for the 
      'About' link, we could have written:

          <router-link :to="{ name: 'About' }">About</router-link>
    
    The name should be that which you specified in the routes array in index.js.
  9. Use this format for the message feed and verify it still works.
