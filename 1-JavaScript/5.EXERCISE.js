/*
1. Create a new myCar object for a car with some properties, including, but not limited to, make and model, 
    and values for a typical car or your car. Feel free to use booleans, strings, or numbers.
2. Create a variable that can hold the string value colour. 
    This variable containing a string value colour can now be used to reference the property name within myCar. 
    Then, use the variable to assign a new value to the colour property in myCar.
3. Use that same variable and assign a new property string value to it, such as forSale. 
    Use the variable to assign a new value to the forSale property to indicate whether the car is available for purchase.
4. Output make and model into the console.
5. Output the value of forSale into the console.
